\chapter*{Abstract}
Edge Computing can be a useful tool to speed up computationally intensive discrete event simulations. Most previous approaches for offloading OMNeT++ simulations are deprecated and cannot communicate peer-to-peer across various networks. This work presents a framework to offload OMNeT++ simulations to an edge computing peer-to-peer network using Go, gRPC, and UDP-Holepunching techniques. The distribution of simulation-runs by this work shows promising results in real-world trials. The execution time was reduced significantly by employing multiple devices across several networks.
